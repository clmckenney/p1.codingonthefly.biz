<p>Hi! I'm currently working as the Communications Manager for the Center for International Development at Harvard University. I have nearly 20 years experience working in broadcast, digital and print communications and have worked for academic, media, corporate, and nonprofit organizations. I spent nearly a decade producing television news programs for WBZ-TV in Boston. I'm proud of my work at the Live Free or Die Alliance - a NH nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting civic engagement - where I helped launch a comprehensive database of hundreds of elected officials. I also 'moonlight' as a sports blogger. I call New Hampshire home and chase around my two young sons.</p>
